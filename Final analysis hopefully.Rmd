## Introduction

In this manuscript, we're going to conduct an analysis into the ELSI Dataset. This is a modified version for usage in the Principles and Practice of Clinical Research program of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The aim here is to replicate the analysis done in a [previous paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968438/) and see if the results also apply to the sample that was included in the [ELSI Brazil](https://elsi.cpqrr.fiocruz.br/en/home-english/).

First order of business is to download the dataset we're going to be analyzing, which was kindly provided by PPCR staff.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Loading the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```

```{r}

## Url provided by PPCR staff
url <- 'https://contattafiles.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tnt45405/T9gKrWnaRr5K0yT/FINAL%20-%20ELSI_students.dta'

## Using the read_dta function from haven to read the .dta file created in STATA
PPCRdata <- read_dta(url)

## Removing the url from memory as it is no longer useful
rm(url)

## Transforming to tibble in order to increase readability
PPCRdata <- as_tibble(PPCRdata)
PPCRdata

```

PPCR Staff has described the variables included in this dataset with the following:
![Variables in modified dataset](https://contattafiles.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tnt45405/3Rq88vSRw93ITf6/Screen%20Shot%202023-10-04%20at%201.03.35%20PM.png)

## Adjusting Variables for the Analysis

Let's now look at the some of the individual variables to understand what they mean
```{r}
unique(PPCRdata$pain)
unique(PPCRdata$p_intensity)
unique(PPCRdata$sleepquality)
unique(PPCRdata$sleepproblems)
```

We can then see that *pain* and *sleepproblems* are binary variables, while *p_intensity* and *sleepquality* are ordinal variables, although they aren't coded in this manner yet.

Now let's transform *p_intensity* and *sleepquality* into ordinal variables and *pain* and *sleepproblems* into binary variables, as they were read as numerical variables with labels.

```{r}
## Using the as_factor function from haven to transform the variables 
## with the labels as names for the levels in the factors
PPCRdata$sleepquality <- as_factor(PPCRdata$sleepquality, ordered = TRUE)
PPCRdata$p_intensity <- as_factor(PPCRdata$p_intensity, ordered = TRUE)
PPCRdata$pain <- as_factor(PPCRdata$pain)
PPCRdata$sleepproblems <- as_factor(PPCRdata$sleepproblems)


levels(PPCRdata$sleepquality)
levels(PPCRdata$p_intensity)
levels(PPCRdata$pain)
levels(PPCRdata$sleepproblems)

## Reversing the order of factors, as initially the order was wrong in sleepquality
PPCRdata$sleepquality <- fct_rev(PPCRdata$sleepquality)
levels(PPCRdata$sleepquality)

```

Other variables that we're going to use in our model that haven't been coded properly as well include: *depression*, *sex*, *alcohol*, *fracture*, *cancer*, *diabetes*, *dementia*, *arthritis*, *heartdisease* and *lungdisease*.
```{r}
## Showing that the variables are coded as numerical variables
unique(PPCRdata$depression)
unique(PPCRdata$sex)
unique(PPCRdata$alcohol)
unique(PPCRdata$fracture)
unique(PPCRdata$cancer)
unique(PPCRdata$diabetes)
unique(PPCRdata$dementia)
unique(PPCRdata$arthritis)
unique(PPCRdata$heartdisease)
unique(PPCRdata$lungdisease)

## Using the as_factor function from haven to transform the variables 
## with the labels as names for the levels in the factors
PPCRdata$depression <- as_factor(PPCRdata$depression)
PPCRdata$sex <- as_factor(PPCRdata$sex)
PPCRdata$alcohol <- as_factor(PPCRdata$alcohol)
PPCRdata$fracture <- as_factor(PPCRdata$fracture)
PPCRdata$cancer <- as_factor(PPCRdata$cancer)
PPCRdata$diabetes <- as_factor(PPCRdata$diabetes)
PPCRdata$dementia <- as_factor(PPCRdata$dementia)
PPCRdata$arthritis <- as_factor(PPCRdata$arthritis)
PPCRdata$heartdisease <- as_factor(PPCRdata$heartdisease)
PPCRdata$lungdisease <- as_factor(PPCRdata$lungdisease)
```
For completeness, let's check all of the variables we're going to use together in a summary
```{r}
PPCRdata %>% dplyr::select(age,bmi,sex,pain,p_intensity,sleepquality,sleepproblems,depression,
                    alcohol,fracture,cancer,diabetes,dementia,arthritis,
                    heartdisease,lungdisease) %>% summary()
```
At this point we have coded all the variables correctly, so we can proceed with the analysis.

## Analysis
### Association between *pain* and *sleepquality*
#### Unadjusted Analysis
This analysis checks for the association between the *pain* variable and the *sleepquality* variable, without adjustments. As *pain* is a binary variable, we're going to run a logistic regression.

```{r}
## using the generalized linear model function 
## with the family = "binomial" to create a logistical
## regression
model0 <- glm (data = PPCRdata, formula = pain ~ sleepquality,
               family = "binomial")
summary(model0)
```

The interpretation of this model regarding our main independent variable, *sleepquality*, is hard to do, as the model is considering it as ordinal. Let's run it again with the model considering it as categorical.

```{r}
## changing the variable to categorical
PPCRdata$sleepquality <- factor(PPCRdata$sleepquality, ordered = FALSE)

## running the model
model2 <- glm (data = PPCRdata, formula = pain ~ sleepquality,
               family = "binomial")
summary(model2)

## reestablishing the variable as ordinal
PPCRdata$sleepquality <- factor(PPCRdata$sleepquality, ordered = TRUE)
```

#### Adjusted Analysis
This analysis checks for the association between the *pain* variable and the *sleepquality* variable, adjusting the model for age, bmi, comorbidities and depression, as was done in the original article. As *pain* is a binary variable, we're going to run a logistic regression.

```{r}
model1 <- glm(data = PPCRdata, formula = pain ~ sleepquality + bmi + depression + 
                       sex + alcohol + fracture + cancer + diabetes + dementia +
                       arthritis + heartdisease + lungdisease,
                                                        family = "binomial")
summary(model1)
```
The interpretation of this model regarding our main independent variable, *sleepquality*, is hard to do, as the model is considering it as ordinal. Let's run it again with the model considering it as categorical.

```{r}
## changing the variable to categorical
PPCRdata$sleepquality <- factor(PPCRdata$sleepquality, ordered = FALSE)

## running the model
model2 <- glm (data = PPCRdata, formula = pain ~ sleepquality + depression + 
                       sex + alcohol + fracture + cancer + diabetes + dementia +
                       arthritis + heartdisease + lungdisease,
                                                        family = "binomial")
summary(model2)

## reestablishing the variable as ordinal
PPCRdata$sleepquality <- factor(PPCRdata$sleepquality, ordered = TRUE)
```

According to the [UCLA Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC)](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/), in order to test for an overall effect of the *sleepquality* variable, we can employ the wald.test function from the aod library.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(aod)
wald.test(b = coef(model2), Sigma = vcov(model2), Terms = 2:5)
```
We can also compute the odds-ratios for each variable.

```{r}
exp(cbind(OR = coef(model2), confint(model2)))
```

#### Testing the assumptions of the model

At this point, I haven't yet learned how to properly test for the assumptions of the logistic regression model. On a later opportunity, I'll try to remedy this situation. For now, I'll include some commands that were listed as useful in the [R you ready for R?](https://bookdown.org/wadetroberts/r-you-ready-for-r/multiple-logistic-regression.html#model-fit-statistics-for-multiple-logistic-regression) e-book. 

```{r warning= FALSE}
library(blorr)
blr_model_fit_stats(model2)
blr_test_hosmer_lemeshow(model2)
blr_roc_curve(blr_gains_table(model2))
car::vif(model2)
```

### Association between *sleepquality* and *pain*

In order to do this analysis I'll try to follow the instructions from the [UCLA OARC - Ordinal Logistic Regression | R Data Analysis Example](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/).

As the original article by [MontelhÃ£o et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968438/) tested for bidirectional associations, let's try to replicate that as well. In this case, the dependent variable is ordinal, therefore we will run an ordinal logistical regression.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## loading the library required to run the model
library(MASS)

## running the model
model3 <- polr (data = PPCRdata, formula = sleepquality ~ pain + depression + 
                       sex + alcohol + fracture + cancer + diabetes + dementia +
                       arthritis + heartdisease + lungdisease, Hess = TRUE)
summary(model3)
```

In R, this doesn't produce the p-values, so let's add those, as our sample size is large enough that they are reasonable approximations.

```{r}
## getting the coefficients
ctable <- coef(summary(model3))

## getting the respective p-values from the normal distribution
p <- pnorm(abs(ctable[, "t value"]), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2

## creating a table with the respective p-values added
ctable <- cbind(ctable, "p value" = p)
ctable

## creating confidence intervals
ci<-confint.default(model3)

## exponentiating the log-odds and the confidence intervals
## in order to create the odds-ratios and the respective CI's
exp(cbind(OR = coef(model3), ci))

```

#### Testing for the Proportional Odds Assumption

This is something to consider further on. At this point, I haven't yet figured out exactly how to do it, but I'll try to follow the instructions from the [Office of Advanced Research Computing](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/) on another day.
